## FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application - Frontend
The FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application is designed and developed internally in the European Food Safety Authority (DATA and AMU units). The frontend of the FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application is fully open source and aims to simplify coding in FoodEx2 by making use of free text food and feed description. More specifically, the application is composed of several web components which allow interfacing with the APIs available on the backend. Please note that the components can also be extracted and hence used outside the scope of the application itself (e.g. in another web platform).
