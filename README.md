## FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application - Frontend
The FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application is designed and developed internally in the European Food Safety Authority (DATA unit). The frontend of the FoodEx2 Smart Coding Application is fully open source and aims to simplify coding in FoodEx2 by making use of free text food and feed description. More specifically, the application is composed of several web components (lit-element framework) which allow interfacing with the APIs available on the backend part. Please note that the components can also be extracted and used outside the scope of the application itself (e.g. in another web platform) in order to expose all or some of the functionalities through different sites.
